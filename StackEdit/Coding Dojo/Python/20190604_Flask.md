* #### Text-Align Method
* 

The “text-align: center” method is perhaps the most common one you’ll see for centering. It’s used mostly for centering text on your HTML page, but it can be used to center divs as well.

****The trick here is to:****

1.  Enclose the div that you want to center with a parent element (commonly known as a wrapper or container)
2.  Set “text-align: center” to parent element
3.  Then set the inside div to “display: inline-block”
