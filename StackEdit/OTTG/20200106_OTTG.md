## Not Sure
Beginning with Ubuntu 12.04, loading the "linux-virtual" package installs a kernel suitable for use as a guest virtual machine. This package always depends on the latest minimal generic kernel image and headers used for virtual machines. While its use is optional, the linux-virtual kernel will load fewer drivers and may boot faster and have less memory overhead than a generic image.

To get full use of Hyper-V, install the appropriate linux-tools and linux-cloud-tools packages to install tools and daemons for use with virtual machines. When using the linux-virtual kernel, load linux-tools-virtual and linux-cloud-tools-virtual.

The following feature distribution map indicates the features in each version. The known issues and workarounds for each distribution are listed after the table.

```
# apt-get update
# apt-get install linux-azure
```
